# BBC Blackjack Implementation
 A terminal-based implementation of Blackjack for the BBC Assessment Centre technical interview


Welcome to my implementation of Blackjack :)
I decided to extend the given task to be a terminal-based fully playable game of blackjack.

# Setup
For this code, the following python libraries are required:
-
-

# Considerations
- I chose to continue with Python as it is a language I am very familiar with
- giving option for betting or excluding entirely as an accessibilty consideration for personal/religious reasons


Functionality-based considerations:
- Allowing multiple decks to be used - avoiding card-counting
[to be added throughout development]

# What have I learned?

I find that I learn something every time I write code.
Here, I have learned about printing in colour in the terminal with python, and also
made my first ASCII art! 

# References
To consolidate my understanding of Blackjack's rules, I consulted:
https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/blackjack-rules.htm
and chose to implement the 'Double Down' rule which was not present in the guidance document.

Python Implementation was mostly from my own previous knowledge, however supplemental research into 
specific functionalities listed below were conducted using the listed sources:
Python Terminal Colour Printing: https://pypi.org/project/colorama/
python deque objects: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque
